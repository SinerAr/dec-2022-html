<p><b>Homer Jay Simpson</b> (born May 12, 1956) is a man from <i>Springfield</i>>. He is the spouse of Marge Simpson and father of
  Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be 239 pounds)[41], lazy, and often ignorant to the
  world around him. Although he has many flaws, he has shown to have great caring, love, and even bravery to those he
  cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Homer popularized the annoyed grunt <strong>"D'oh!"</strong>> (made memorable through Dan Castellaneta's distinctive voice work),
    which began as an abbreviated form of James Finlayson's annoyed "Dooooh" in Laurel and Hardy films and other
    comedy shorts. This modern interjection has found enough popular acceptance to be included in the Oxford English
    Dictionary.
  </li>
  <li>He also popularized the catchphrase "<b>Mmm...</b>". Many examples of other "<b>Mmm...</b>"s are "Mmm... candy", "<b>Mmm...</b> pointy", or
    "<b>Mmm...</b> hug". He has used it less lately.
